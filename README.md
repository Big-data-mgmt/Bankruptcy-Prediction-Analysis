ABOUT PROJECT: 
The objective of predicting bankruptcy or financial distress is the development of an assessment model that allows to predict financial condition of an organization by combining different financial measures. Effective prediction of bankruptcy is crucial for making reasonable lending decisions by financial institutions. In order to determine the creditworthiness of prospective borrowers, many potential lenders use credit scoring models to help lenders select the factors that allow them to distinguish between good and bad credit risks, such as default or bankruptcy.

ABOUT DATASET:
The dataset used is about bankruptcy prediction of Polish companies. The data was collected from Emerging Markets Information Service (EMIS), which is a database containing information on emerging markets around the world. 
The bankrupt companies were analyzed in the period 2000-2012, while the still operating companies were evaluated from 2007 to 2013.
